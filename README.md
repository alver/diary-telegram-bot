# Diary Bot

A personal Telegram bot that acts as a daily diary. Send it text notes, voice messages, or audio files and they are saved as daily Markdown files. The bot also uses Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) to check in on your mood at randomized times and asks a daily sleep-quality question, storing the time-series data for later analysis.

---

## Features

- **Text messages** → appended to `storage/diary/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- **Voice & audio messages** → downloaded, converted to 16 kHz mono WAV via ffmpeg, transcribed with whisper.cpp, then saved to the diary
- **Archive copies** → 32 kbps MP3 of every audio file saved to `storage/archive/` (the filename referenced from the diary)
- **Clean chat** → after successful processing the bot deletes the user's message and its own replies, keeping the chat at zero items
- **Crash recovery** → audio left mid-transcription is retried on the next start via `.pending` markers
- **Mood check-ins (2-D, circumplex model)** → a single keyboard asks for both **pleasantness** and **energy** on 1–5 scales; responses saved to `storage/mood_entries.csv` and to the diary
- **Randomized ping times** → instead of fixed clock times, each daily ping fires at a random moment within ±`PING_WINDOW_MINUTES` of its base time (re-rolled each day, with an enforced minimum gap between pings) — reduces anticipation bias while keeping a stable daily rhythm
- **Response timeouts** → each prompt stores both `prompt_sent_at` and `responded_at`; pings unanswered within `RESPONSE_TIMEOUT_MINUTES` are marked `missed` (or `partial` for mood if only one scale was picked), and late taps are rejected with an alert — no reminder pings, no notification fatigue
- **Sleep quality check** → once per day at a fixed time the bot asks a PSQI component-1 question (Very good / Fairly good / Fairly bad / Very bad); responses saved to `storage/sleep.csv`
- **Silero VAD (optional)** → whisper.cpp skips silent regions for large speedups on diary-style recordings with long pauses
- **Modular transcription** → drop in a new backend under `services/transcription/` without touching anything else

## Requirements

| Tool | Notes |
|---|---|
| Python 3.11+ | Tested on 3.11 / 3.12 |
| ffmpeg | On `PATH`, or set `FFMPEG_EXE` to an absolute path |
| whisper.cpp binary | The `whisper.exe` / `whisper` ggml CLI build |
| A ggml model file | e.g. `ggml-large-v3-q5_0.bin` from [ggerganov/whisper.cpp releases](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/releases) |
| Silero VAD model (optional) | `ggml-silero-v6.2.0.bin` — fetch via `./models/download-vad-model.sh silero-v6.2.0` in the whisper.cpp tree |

---

## Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone / copy this directory
cd diary_bot

# 2. Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
# Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS / Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate

# 3. Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Copy and fill in the environment file
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — at minimum set BOT_TOKEN, ALLOWED_USER_IDS, DIARY_CHAT_ID,
# WHISPER_MODEL_PATH, and WHISPER_EXE
```

### Getting a bot token

1. Open Telegram and message [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
2. Send `/newbot` and follow the prompts
3. Copy the token into `BOT_TOKEN` in `.env`

### Finding your Telegram user ID

Message [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot) — it replies with your numeric user ID. Put this in both `ALLOWED_USER_IDS` and `DIARY_CHAT_ID`.

---

## Running

```bash
python bot.py
```

The bot uses long-polling, so no public URL or webhook is needed.

To keep it running persistently on a server, wrap it in systemd, supervisord, screen, or tmux.

### Example systemd unit

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Diary Telegram Bot

## Diary format

Each daily file looks like:

```markdown
---

**2026-04-14 09:03**

Had a good meeting this morning.

---

**2026-04-14 07:42**

**Sleep:** night of 2026-04-13 — quality 2/4

---

**2026-04-14 09:15**

**Mood check-in:** pleasantness 4/5, energy 2/5 (complete)

---

**2026-04-14 11:42**

*[Audio: 20260414_114200.mp3]*

This is the transcribed text of the voice message.
```

The filename points at the 32 kbps archive MP3 in `storage/archive/`. The original download and intermediate WAV are removed after successful transcription.

---

## Mood data (`storage/mood_entries.csv`)

Each row is one mood ping. The two scales follow the circumplex model of affect (Russell, 1980):

- **pleasantness** — 1 (very unpleasant) → 5 (very pleasant)
- **energy** — 1 (very low / sleepy) → 5 (very high / wired)

```
entry_id,prompt_sent_at,responded_at,pleasantness,energy,status
m20260414091532,2026-04-14T09:15:02+02:00,2026-04-14T09:15:32+02:00,4,2,complete
m20260414143012,2026-04-14T14:30:12+02:00,,,,missed
m20260414201805,2026-04-14T20:18:05+02:00,2026-04-14T20:21:10+02:00,3,,partial
```

`status` is `complete` (both scales tapped within the timeout), `partial` (only one scale), or `missed` (no response).

## Sleep data (`storage/sleep.csv`)

One row per day — a simplified PSQI component-1 rating (1 very good → 4 very bad):

```
entry_id,prompt_sent_at,responded_at,night_of,sleep_quality,status
s20260414090005,2026-04-14T09:00:05+02:00,2026-04-14T09:01:12+02:00,2026-04-13,2,complete
```

Both CSVs are ready to load into pandas, a spreadsheet, or any analysis tool to look for patterns, periodicity, good/bad zones, pleasantness-vs-energy quadrants, sleep→mood correlations, etc.

---

## Adding a new transcription backend

1. Create `services/transcription/my_service.py` with a class that extends `TranscriptionService` and implements `transcribe(wav_path: str) -> str`.
2. Register it in `services/transcription/__init__.py`'s `get_transcription_service()` factory.
3. Set `TRANSCRIPTION_SERVICE=my_service` in `.env`.

Planned backends (not yet implemented):

- `openai_whisper` — OpenAI Whisper API
- `faster_whisper` — [faster-whisper](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper) (local, GPU-accelerated)
- `whisper_python` — openai-whisper Python package

---

## What comes next

- **Mood analysis script** — load `mood_entries.csv` + `sleep.csv`, detect trends and periodicity, plot pleasantness-energy scatter and sleep→mood correlations
- **Weekly/monthly diary summary** — aggregate entries and send a recap via the bot
- **Search command** — `/search <keyword>` over diary Markdown files
- **Export command** — send a ZIP of all diary files on demand
